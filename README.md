[![Optical flow implementation using OpenCV on iOS ](http://img.youtube.com/vi/vHlt5Iye07o/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/w18ggwM8-X8)

This example is using calcOpticalFlowPyrLK method to compute optical-flow using Lucas-Kanade algorithm. 
It's based on original [demo](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/blob/master/samples/cpp/lkdemo.cpp) provided with OpenCV.

* tap to add circle for tracking
* double tap to focus
* shake to remove circles for tracking
